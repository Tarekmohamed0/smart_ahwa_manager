# Smart Ahwa Manager App ☕

A simple **console-based Dart app** to help a coffee shop (*ahwa*) owner in Cairo manage daily operations.  
The app demonstrates **core OOP concepts** and applies **SOLID principles** to keep the code modular, extendable, and easy to maintain.  

---

## 📌 Features
- Add new orders with:
  - Customer name  
  - Drink type (Shai, Turkish Coffee, Hibiscus Tea)  
  - Special instructions (e.g., “extra mint, ya rais”)  
- Edit existing orders (change name, drink, or notes).  
- Mark orders as completed ✅.  
- View pending orders.  
- View all orders (completed + pending).  
- Generate reports:  
  - Total number of orders  
  - Top-selling drinks  

---

## 🏛 OOP Concepts in Action
- **Encapsulation:**  
  Order fields are private with getters/setters and update methods, so the state is always controlled.  

- **Inheritance & Polymorphism:**  
  Drinks (`Shai`, `TurkishCoffee`, `HibiscusTea`) inherit from an abstract `Drink` class.  

- **Abstraction:**  
  `Report` and `OrderRepository` are abstract classes/interfaces. Different implementations can extend or implement them.  

---

## 🧩 SOLID Principles Applied
- **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle):**  
  - `Order` only stores order data.  
  - `OrderManager` handles order operations.  
  - `Report` classes handle reporting logic.  

- **OCP (Open-Closed Principle):**  
  - Add new drinks by creating a new subclass of `Drink`.  
  - Add new reports (e.g., daily revenue) by creating a new `Report` class without touching old code.  

- **DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle):**  
  - `OrderManager` depends on the abstraction `OrderRepository`.  
  - Current implementation uses `InMemoryOrderRepository`, but can be swapped with a database or Firestore later.
